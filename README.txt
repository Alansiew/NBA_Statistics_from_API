First of all you need to have installed requests module, to do it use a cmd Path\easy_install.exe requests, where Path is your Python*\Scripts folder, if it was installed. (For example: C:\Python32\Scripts)
or just pip3 install requests for python3
1.You can open and run the scripts in python IDLE

2. You can use cmd.exe:

get to the script path by  using command in cmd: cd\script path\
then type desired script

for example you want get all teams grouped by division
cd\script path\ 
then input group_division.py

for Get players with a specific name who is the tallest and another one who weight the most
input players.py then input player name or last name

for Get statistics for a given season and store it
input season_statistic.py then input desired season year in YYYY format
If you want to save file press Y, if not press N or anything else
